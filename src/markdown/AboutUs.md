## About Us

The Valley Rail Working Group is a nonpartisan coalition group based in the Thompson-Okanagan region of British Columbia, Canada. Our shared goal is to bring efficient, environmentally-friendly passenger rail to the region, from Osoyoos to Kelowna to Kamloops.

The backbone organizations of this group are the [Thompson Okanagan Tourism Association (TOTA)](https://www.totabc.org/) and [The Okanagan Transit Alliance (OTA)](https://www.okanagantransit.com/).
We're working on connecting with municipal, provincial, and First Nations governments in the region order to bring this vision into reality.

## Land acknowledgement

We acknowledge that we live and work on the traditional, ancestral land of the Syilx Okanagan people and Secwépmc people. We acknowledge that in the past, freight rail in Canada was often built without permission from or even consultation with Indigenous groups, and that these actions contributed to a painful and exploitative colonial dynamic across Canada that affects us to this day.

In the mindset of truth and reconciliation, we hope to learn from these past mistakes so we don’t repeat them in the future. Guided by the principles of respect, trust, and inclusion, we’ll continue to seek input and involvement from Indigenous governing bodies in the area so we can foster more positive relationships moving forward.
